## Big Data

### Description

Using the fundamentals of data infrastructure and showing how technologies fit together to form a process — or pipeline — to refine data into usable datasets.

### Objectives

1. Explain big data architecture and the engineering trade-offs of different data storage and data processing paradigms
2. Process real-time data streams from multiple input sources
3. Integrate datasets from multiple disparate sources and systems using batch and real-time data processing
4. Construct data processing and machine learning pipelines using directed acyclic graphs (DAG) workflows

### Files

A various assortment of different files that are being used to interact with numerous kinds of "big data" from parsing email messages to reading real-time data from self-driving vehicles.
